Project Title: Smart Management of EV Charging Stations Using AI Chatbot and GMAPS API

Objective:
The primary goal of this project was to develop a hybrid web-based Android application aimed at EV (Electric Vehicle) car owners. The application provides a slot booking system for charging stations, allowing users to reserve a slot before reaching the station. Additionally, the system features an AI voice chatbot that interacts with users through vocal commands, enhancing user convenience and accessibility.

Key Features:

Slot Booking System: Allows users to check the availability of slots at various EV charging stations and book a slot in advance, ensuring a hassle-free charging experience.
AI Voice Chatbot: Integrates an AI chatbot that helps users interact with the application using voice commands, making it user-friendly, especially for those who prefer voice interactions.
GMAPS API Integration: Utilizes Google Maps API to provide location-based services, helping users find the nearest charging station and navigate to it seamlessly.
Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Java
Web Technologies: Servlets, Tomcat
Version Control: Git
Database: SQL
Development Approach: Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
Challenges Addressed:

Ensured real-time slot availability updates to prevent double bookings.
Implemented a user-friendly interface that simplifies the booking process.
Integrated AI capabilities to handle voice commands effectively, providing a hands-free experience.
Outcome: The project successfully demonstrated the integration of AI and web technologies to address a real-world problem faced by EV car owners. It received positive feedback for its innovative approach and practical application, with the potential for further development and commercialization.
